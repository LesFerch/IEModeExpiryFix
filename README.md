#IEModeExpiryFix
##Set IE Mode pages to expire far in the future

This VBS script sets your Edge IE Mode pages to a "Date added" in 2099 (can be edited to any date), which causes the expiry to also be in 2099. It also provides features for clearing all existing IE Mode pages, adding pages via the script, and searching and replacing strings in the Edge Preferences file. See the comments in the script for more details.

You can download the script in **ZIP** format via the green **Code** button or download it directlly as a **VBS** file by clicking on the script link and then either **Alt-Click** the **Raw** button (disabled in some browsers) or **Right-Click** the **Raw** button and select **Save link as...**.

The script requires no modifications to set the expiry on URLs that are already in Edge's IE Mode list. See the comments in the script to see how to use it to add sites to the IE Mode list at the same time as setting their expiry.

Note: The script only works with 100% local Edge profiles. It will not work if you are logged into Edge (i.e. synced profiles).
